<h1 class="title">My Skills</h1>

<p>I use many technologies my favorites include:</p>
<ul>
	<br /><br />
	<p>Docker</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Docker is a tool I use everyday, from creating reproducable development enviornments, to wrapping services for deployment. I am able to write minimal base images optimized for space.</p>
	<br /><br />
	<p>Rust</p>
	<hr />
	<p>The server this site runs on is <a href="https://rocket.rs" target="_blank">rocket.rs</a> which means the backend routing logic for the site is written 100% in Rust!</p>
	<br /><br />
	<p> Go</p>
	<hr />
	<p>I write Go code sometimes to not nearly as much as with other languages but I find some of it's libraries really usefull. I also know how to write goroutines which is fun!</p>
	<br /><br />
	<p>Linux/Unix</p>
	<hr />
	<p>I've always loved UNIX, and the command line, specifically I love building advanced command line shells. I know how to use both canonical(cooked) mode, and noncanonical(raw). Also advanced command line argument parsers.</p>
	<br /><br />
	<p>Bash</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Bash is one of my favoraite tools. I am adept with Bash scripting/misc bash stuffs including how to write Manpages command substitution, piping etc. I mainly use it for composing applications together and I use it for Docker helper scripts</p>
	<br /><br />
	<p>Python</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Python was my first programming language, I usually use this for rapid prototyping, automation, and glue code. Some popular libraries that I use are Python Prompt Toolkit and Flask</p>
	<br /><br />
  </ul>
